					<h1>A romantic eating knife&#8230;!?</h1>
					<p>Confession time&#8230;</p>
					<p>I am a hopeless romantic</p>
					<p>So for valentines day this year I made my fella (unfortunately no longer my fella&#8230;word to the wise, don&#8217;t arm your partners, they will still be armed after the relationship, I gave him an axe for Christmas&#8230;what was I thinking!?) I digress. I made my chap an in character eating knife, well this isn&#8217;t strictly true, I bought the knife from the <a title="WYG" href="https://www.facebook.com/whatsyourgamegloucester" target="_blank">What&#8217;s Your Game</a>&nbsp;trade fair, from who? Unfortunately I cannot remember to be able to give them a shout out&#8230;maybe they&#8217;ll see this post and be able to contact me on Facebook so I can link them in. (I digress again) So! This particular knife caught my eye because of the handle far and above the blade, a beautiful cherry coloured bit of wood, when talking to the vendor of these wares, he informed me that he had made the blade of the knife from an old metal file, which I just thought was grand. So I purchased it. I decided it needed personalising and making slightly more aristocratic as my chap of the time has incredibly decadent tastes. So I decided to etch the blade with a sand blaster, and engrave the handle with Latin. And this is what I came up with.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><em>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em>For the handle I simply engraved the words in free hand using a dremel</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><em><img title="Blade" src="http://nicmods.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Blade_900_1200.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" /></em></p>
					<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>For the blade I painstakingly masked off a pattern on one side of the blade and scalpeled it in, taking the off cuts and sticking them onto the other &nbsp; &nbsp; side to invert the pattern, and then I sandblasted it very carefully, trying to make sure that masking tape didn&#8217;t come off, I wasn&#8217;t entirely successful, but, the final effect pleased me.&nbsp;</p>
					<p><em><img title="Knife full" src="http://nicmods.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Knife_full_900_675.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" /></em></p>
					<p><em>&nbsp;</em>One of the things I really like about the blade is the fact is been made from a file, not only is it up cycled metal, it&#8217;s pre aged, it looks old, used and loved. In the film industry we spend a lot of time and effort ageing items and props to stop them from looking spanking and new, give them an authentic look, so I was pleased that this came pre aged! It looks like it can have a great story to tell&#8230; And be useful to eat with. I hope the fella lucky enough to have this unique, one of a kind, never-to-be-made-again (you get my point) item is truly happy with it and uses it well. I&#8217;m looking forward to it&#8217;s story beginning.</p>
