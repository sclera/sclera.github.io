        <h2>Part One</h2>
        <p>Thunder cracked overhead, its roar echoing through the cold dark underpass. I felt the muscles in my back flex and strain in response to the electricity in the air, it was a strange sensation, one that even now I had never got used to. The storm had been raging for days now, unrelenting, unmoving, hovering over this once great city.</p>

<p>I picked up my rucksack, edging to the mouth of the tunnel, peering out on to the dust filled pavement and road beyond. It was nearly time, the sun was dipping below the burned out buildings to the west, the remains of the station bathed in an eerie red glow. Shadows creeped and crawled their way across the road, silently turning the city from day to night.</p>

<p>Lightning flashed its forked tongue hitting a tower in the distance, reaching down from the clouds like an angry god striking out at that once great symbol of wealth. This tower, once known for being the tallest, most decadent building in this city was little more than a skeleton these days. In it's day, a decade or so before, The Shard had been a glittering monument celebrating a nations wealth, a monument to show its engineering prowess, now it was a different sort of monument, a headstone, standing over this graveyard of a city.</p>

<p>Again I felt the power flare within me, the wave of electrical energy fanning out from the lightning like a ripple in a pond. I could feel every hair on my arms standing on end, if I still had hair on my closely shaven head I'm sure it would have been as well. </p>

<p>Ten years ago, not long after The Event, not long after this power awakened in me, there was a similar storm. I remember my younger brother, Jack, pointing and laughing at me as my bright blond hair stood on end turning me into a human dandelion clock. Despite the mocking, despite how I looked I had never felt so alive, so full of potential, so charged. </p>

<p>We had been in the old tunnels underneath the old Waterloo station, returning from a looting trip north of the river heavy laden with supplies, struggling under the weight of our bounty. The lightning, the charge, I suddenly felt renewed, refreshed, superhuman, invincible. The packs light in my arms, I remember picking Jack up, carrying both him and our packs through the tunnels, laughing and joking as we went. How quickly things change, a year later Jack would be gone, another looting trip turned sour, the Enforcers cutting off our retreat...</p>

<p>Lightning ripped through the sky again, I could feel my muscles pulsing with the power, ripples of thunder chasing across my skin. I ducked out of the tunnel, heading north, running towards the tower. Not towards the skeletal structure of The Shard but towards the glowing mass behind it blotting out the sky to the north, The Tower, the home of NeoGov and its army of Enforcers.</p>
